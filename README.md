# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to visualize a given data set using Tableau with the aim of providing useful insight from the visualizations and answering some questions through an interactive dashboard.

## Process
The given data set is reviewed for cleanliness and loaded in Tableau public.To ensure that the data is ready for use, the columns were carefully inspected to see that  they are in the right data types.Null values where also identified and  replaced appropriately. Different visualization sheets were generated in tableau and and agregated to a dashboard.


## Results
The data set used for this analysis is the 'Cause of Death' data obtained from kaggle.This is  a data set containing information on the different global annual causes of death (33 causes were listed in the data) figures from 1990 till 2019.

Analysing this data set is important as it can provide insight into what  the leading causes of death are at the global level.This can ultimately be a reference document for  everyone especially  high stakeholders involved in management of the health sectors of countries and see what actions can be takeen to tame these causees.

In the analysis,I deployed  different visualisations like line graphs,bubbles,bar plots and maps to analyse the data and with these the following questions where answered.
1.The leading causes of death globally from 1990 till 2019
2.Leading causes of death for different countries from 1990 to 2019
3.Estimated cummulative death between these periods.
We should also note that to accurately compare death figures of one country to another-Mortality rate their  population size should be compared. The reason why  we have more more death figures in countries with high populations.


## Challenges 
As a rooky in tableau, it took me more time to  bring out relevant visualisations needed ,however i am certain that with more practice i would better using the application.

## Future Goals
I would have also love to do more visualisations and probably categorize the data into different categories like grouping countries to reflect their different continents, region and similar economies etc and analyze the data along these different  lines.
